This is how you run my code on the real robot:


Run : 

Create a conda environment and pip install tf-agents, numpy and ipython
open a new terminal - conda activate the environment 


1. cd to the package directory then run source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
2. cd to src and chmod +x task2_robot.py
3. GEt the robot ip address and the ip address of the host machine , then run 

export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://[robot_ip]:11311
export ROS_HOSTNAME=[host_ip]
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi


Run: rosrun P1_T2 task2_robot.py

The file is set to test mode for running on the real robot
